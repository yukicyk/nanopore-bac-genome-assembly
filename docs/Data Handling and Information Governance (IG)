# Data Handling and Information Governance (IG)

Scope: This repository uses only public/demo data. No personal data (PHI/PII) is stored.

Principles
- Data minimisation (UK GDPR/DPA 2018): do not include identifiable data.
- Pseudonymisation: use linked_clinical_record_id only as a pseudonymous key; keep mapping separately with access control.
- Integrity and availability: maintain checksums (SHA256) and off-host backups for raw signals, FASTQ, and logs.

Practices
- Paths not payload: store file paths in manifests; raw data is gitignored.
- Access control: restrict write access; use code review (PRs).
- Retention: define lab-specific retention periods; document deletion procedures.
- Audit trail: use Git history and release notes; record deviations in docs/Deviation_OOS_CAPA_Template.md.
